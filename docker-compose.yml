version: '3.1'

# Extensions are not support until 3.4 thus the repeated boilerplate below.

# We mount the struct2tensor project root at /struct2tensor (which is the WORKDIR of the image)
# in the container.
#
# The expected environment variables to be set are PYTHON_VERSION and TF_VERSION
# Valid PYTHON_VERSION are 35|36|37|27
# Valid TF_VERSION are NIGHTLY_TF|NIGHTLY_TF_2|RELEASED_TF|PRERELEASED_TF|RELEASED_TF_2|PRERELEASED_TF_2
# Sample usage:
# docker-compose build manylinux2010
# docker-compose run -e PYTHON_VERSION=36 -e TF_VERSION=NIGHTLY_TF manylinux2010
