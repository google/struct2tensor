# This script is expected to run in the docker container defined in
# Dockerfile.manylinux2014
# Assumptions:
# - Based on TF SIG Build Dockerfile.
# - Will use manylinux2014 compatible devtoolset under /dt9
# - $PWD is struct2tensor's project root.
# - Python/pip/wheel/auditwheel are available in $PATH.
# - patchelf, zip, bazelisk, rsync are installed and are in $PATH.
