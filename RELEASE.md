## Release 0.26.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Created a docker image that contains a TF model server with struct2tensor
    ops linked. This docker image is available at
    `gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/s2t_tf_serving` .
*   Add support for string_views for intermediate serialized protos. To use, set
    the option "use_string_view" in CalculateOptions to true. string_views are
    potentially more memory bandwidth efficient depending on the depth and
    complexity of the input proto.

## Release 0.25.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   From this release Struct2Tensor will also be hosting nightly packages on
    https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org. To install the nightly package use the
    following command:

    ```
    pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple struct2tensor
    ```

    Note: These nightly packages are unstable and breakages are likely to
    happen. The fix could often take a week or more depending on the complexity
    involved for the wheels to be available on the PyPI cloud service. You can
    always use the stable version of struct2tensor available on PyPI by running
    the command `pip install struct2tensor` .

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Update __init__.py to import the API, instead of just the modules.
*   Provide an __init__.py for struct2tensor.expression_impl directory. This is
    meant for power users.
*   Update python notebook to use import style.
*   Fix bug in prensor_to_structured_tensor.
*   Depends on `tensorflow-metadata>=0.25,<0.26`.
