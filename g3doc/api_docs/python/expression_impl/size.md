Functions for creating new size or has expression.


Given a field "foo.bar",

```
root = size(expr, path.Path(["foo","bar"]), "bar_size")
```

creates a new expression root that has an optional field "foo.bar_size", which
is always present, and contains the number of bar in a particular foo.

```
root_2 = has(expr, path.Path(["foo","bar"]), "bar_has")
```

creates a new expression root that has an optional field "foo.bar_has", which
is always present, and is true if there are one or more bar in foo.

## Classes
